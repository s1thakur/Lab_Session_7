# Lab_Session_7
Reflection on Lab_Session_3

Previous Claim: The financial markets do punish security breaches as stock prices have decreased recently in 2 companies and other stocks are constant.

In my lab session-3 claim I picked two companies with major changes in their stock values over years and compared their trends. Based on their trends, I concluded that financial markets are being punished for security breaches. Visualization only shows pattern for 2 companies and does not shows any link to the security breach punishment. Hence its not an effective visualization, making claim worthless.

To show the link between stock changes and the records lost, first we need to analyze each separately. 
We start with organization’s stock trends over years.

We can see the constant increase in stock values for all organizations with a few exceptions like 2005 increase, 2006 decrease, 2012 increase, 2014 increase. All major changes have primarily occurred in three organizations- web, healthcare and financial. We can filter them out to see if there’s any connection between these drastic changes in stock values and record lost by the same organizations at same point of time.

We can see increase in records lost by web organization starts in 2010 followed by major increase in 2012 after which it remains constant for a year and then drops with next change in 2016. There is no link between the trends of stock values and records lost.
We can conclude the same for other 2 organizations as well by looking at their graphs.

Hence the final visualization depicts that there is no connection between stock values and records lost over specific timeframe. 

Claim: The financial markets do not punish security breaches as stock prices.
